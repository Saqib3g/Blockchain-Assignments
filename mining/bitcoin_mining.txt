To begin with, it's important to understand that bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that is based on a distributed ledger technology called 
the blockchain. The blockchain is a public record of all bitcoin transactions that have ever taken place. It is maintained by a network of computers, 
called nodes, that are spread across the world.
Mining is the process of verifying and adding transactions to the blockchain. When a user sends a transaction, it is broadcast to the network and added 
to a pool of unconfirmed transactions. Miners take transactions from this pool and try to create a new block that includes these transactions.
To create a new block, miners must solve a complex mathematical problem. This problem is designed to be difficult to solve, but easy to verify. 
The problem is based on the data in the block, and it involves finding a specific numerical value, called a nonce, that meets certain requirements.

When a miner successfully solves a block, they are rewarded with a small amount of bitcoin. The reward is designed to be an incentive for miners to 
continue contributing their computational resources to the network.

The process of mining requires a lot of computational power and energy. Miners use specialized computers, called mining rigs, to solve the mathematical 
problems. These computers are specifically designed to be fast and efficient at solving the problems, and they consume a lot of electricity in the
process.

As more bitcoin are mined, the difficulty of the mathematical problems that need to be solved increases, which requires more computational power to solve. 
This helps to ensure that the rate at which new bitcoin are created remains consistent over time, despite the increasing number of miners participating in 
the network.
